# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

It started to become a bit overwhelming when trying to include everything and figure out the correct syntax for all of the different things we've learned.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

The amount of work is about at the maximum I think I could reasonably do while still maintaining a healthy study/life balance.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

How the classes work along with all of the other things we've learned.
